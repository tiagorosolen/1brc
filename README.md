My own attempt to solve the 1 billion row challenge

This is a "vanilla C#" implementation, so no pointers, no unsafe, no C++ like stuff.

A basic and clean solution that does the thing in an acceptable 30s.

I know, I know... the other guys can do it in less than 2s. True, but thay are using unsafe and I don't want to do that.

Please enjoy my memory-safe 1 billion row challenge solution.
